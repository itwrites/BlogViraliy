Ultra-Clear Layout & UI Description for Bolt.new

The theme is designed as a clean, modern magazine homepage with a strong visual hierarchy. It uses large images, structured grids, and lots of white space to create a premium reading experience.

🔷 PAGE STRUCTURE
1. Header

A full-width top bar, white background.

Left: Logo.

Center or left-aligned: Navigation links arranged horizontally.

Right: Search icon and a small “Sign in” button.

Thin bottom separator line to distinguish the header from the content.

2. Hero Section (Top Featured Area)

A two-column layout occupying the full width of the main content area.

Left Side (Main Feature)

A large rectangular image that takes up roughly 65% of the width.

Below the image:

Category label (small, uppercase).

Large headline (2–3 lines max).

Short descriptive text (1–2 lines).

Right Side (Secondary Features)

A vertical column showing three smaller feature cards stacked top to bottom.

Each card contains:

A medium-sized image at the top.

Category label.

Short title (1 line).

Cards are evenly spaced with consistent padding.

This entire section should feel like the front page of a digital magazine.

3. Category Section (e.g., “Electronics”)

Below the hero section, each category is displayed in a structured block.

Top of the Category Block

Left: Category title (bold).

Right: A small “View all” link.

Article Grid

A row of four article cards, evenly spaced.

Each card includes:

A medium rectangular image at the top.

The article title (2 lines max).

A small piece of metadata below (for example: date).

Card style:

Slightly rounded corners.

Soft shadow.

Uniform spacing around all four cards.

4. Additional Categories (e.g., “Trends”)

Each category repeats the exact same structure:

Title row

Four-card grid

Spacing between sections is generous so each block feels well-defined.

🔷 CARD DESIGN (Consistent Across the Site)

Every article card follows the same rules:

Image at the top, full width of the card.

Rounded corners.

Below the image:

Title in medium-weight text.

Metadata in smaller, lighter text.

Cards have a clean, minimalistic feel with plenty of padding.

Hover state: subtle lift or shadow increase.

🔷 OVERALL UI STYLE

Very clean and modern, similar to online technology magazines.

Large, high-quality images dominate the layout.

Lots of white space so the content feels breathable.

Simple, readable text, no clutter.

Clear hierarchy: big feature → category sections → article grids.
